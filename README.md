*********************DESCRIPTION***********************************************************
Age of Carr is a two player strategy game. Each player has it's own 
base, characters, gold and turrets. Players must decisively use the gold that they are
given to destroy the opponents base and defend their own as well. They can do so by summoning 
the three different level of characters (melee, ranged and boss) or by purchasing turrets.
Whichever player destroys the other player's base first wins.

*********************THINGS TO NOTICE*****************************************************************
